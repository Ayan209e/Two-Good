This ensures that the impact of our program doesn’t end when the program ends; we’re looking to change the course of someone’s life in the long term, rather than an immediate fix.",

    about:
      "The idea of connecting people through food has stuck with Rob since his grandmother introduced him to a soup kitchen at the age of 12. In 2010, as an engineer in the construction industry, he founded an organic soup kitchen in Sydney's Kings Cross with the intention of bringing people together to share a meal. The success of the soup kitchen led him to attempt to scale the impact through business, by creating social enterprise Two Good Co. Realising that their social impact was greater working with women who have experienced domestic violence, Two Good pivoted to focus on a mission to change the course of the lives of vulnerable women. With the support of many great people and companies Two Good Co is on a mission to employ and empower more and more women every year.",
