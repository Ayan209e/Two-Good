        <p>
          We know that many people healing from crisis have lost faith in
          themselves, and in the world around them. So everything we do - every
          decision we make - is infused with love and care, to restore someoneâ€™s
          self worth and dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every meal and gift we donate is a gift of kindness to remind them
          that they are not alone; a message that we see them, we love them, and
          they matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          What happens after that moment, is their choice - but whenever they're
          ready to CHANGE THEIR COURSE, we're ready to walk alongside them.
